WHAT IS THE CAKEPHP FULL CALENDAR PLUGIN?
-----------------------------------------

The CakePHP Full Calendar Plugin allows you to easily integrate
the jQuery based Full Calendar application with your CakePHP 
application for a slick ajax event calendar.

The plugin brings the following MIT licensed software (see
LICENCE) together to create a simple and sleek experience:

-CakePHP (http://cakephp.org)
 Required by this plugin

-Full Calendar (http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar)
 The jQuery based Calendar

-jQuery (http://jquery.com)
 Required by Full Calendar

-jQuery UI (http://jqueryui.com)
 Required for draggable and resizable events

-qTip (http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip)
 A jQuery plugin for hover details

WHY?
----

While working on another project I needed a visual calendar for
event management for multiple users/accounts. From that project
I decided to simplify the calendar and turn it into a plugin
because there didn't appear to be a clean (easy to install and
use) CakePHP Calendar plugin out there.

In it's current form this plugin is for a single user though I
plan on creating a few associated plugins to allow for multiple
users, etc.

THE INSTALLATION PROCESS
------------------------

NOTE: These instructions assume you already have a working copy
of CakePHP with a database connection on your web server.

You can read up on CakePHP installation and DB config here:
http://book.cakephp.org/#!/view/913/Development AND
http://book.cakephp.org/#!/view/922/Database-Configuration


INSTALLED IN 4 SIMPLE STEPS

1. Download or fork the CakePHP Full Calendar Plugin at:
   https://github.com/silasmontgomery/CakePHP-Full-Calendar-Plugin

2. Create the folder "FullCalendar" in your "app/Plugin" directory 
   and copy the Config, Controller, Model, View, and webroot 
   folders into it.

3. Create an "events" and "event_types" table by importing the
   "FullCalendar.sql" file found in the "FullCalendar/Config" 
   directory (Using PHPMyAdmin, command-line, etc).

4. In your Cake installation, edit "app/Config/bootstrap.php" 
   and add the line "CakePlugin::load('FullCalendar');" at the 
   bottom.

THAT'S IT!

You should now be able to access the Full Calendar Plugin at:
http://yoursite.com/full_calendar

You should add some Event Types first. Then you can start
scheduling some Events!
